## My Process

### Built with
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) 
- [Svelte Intersection Observer](https://github.com/metonym/svelte-intersection-observer)
- CSS Keyframes Animations

### What I Learned

First Svelte project, so I'm sure there's much to be improved upon. Still getting used to component-based structure/development, but so far I like it! The offical Svelte tutorial is fantastic, and I found The Net Ninja's video tutorials (link in Useful Resources) also immensely helpful.

Safari continues to plague me. ~~In this project, the `.invalid` and `focus` styles for the input are not showing up, and I can't figure out why. Any insight into this will be greatly appreciated! The CSS mouse animation also had some serious issues in Safari, so I opted to have the original svg icon be displayed both in Safari and for those who prefer reduced motion.~~

**Edit:** Turns out my Safari was out of date! üòÖ Everything works in 15.4 üëç Well, almost. Keyboard tabbing doesn't seem to pick up the maker logo in the header as a link, seemingly skipping it in Safari. The outlines also display oddly on the attribution links when tabbing through them. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
