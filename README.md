## My Process

### Built with
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) 
- [Svelte Intersection Observer](https://github.com/metonym/svelte-intersection-observer)
- CSS Keyframes Animations

### What I Learned

First Svelte project, so I'm sure there's much to be improved upon. Still getting used to component-based structure/development, but so far I like it! 

Safari continues to plague me. In this project, the `.invalid` and `focus` styles for the input are not showing up, and I can't figure out why. Any insight into this will be greatly appreciated! The CSS mouse animation also had some serious issues in Safari, so I opted to have the original svg icon be displayed both in Safari and for those who prefer reduced motion.

Speaking of, the animated mouse is heavily inspired by (read: balatantly stolen and lightly tinkered with) [Ryan Mulligan's CSS Site Scroll Micro Animation](https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/aZWOdE) - link also in resource section.
